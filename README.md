# ðŸ§  MedCV SimLab â€“ Xiangâ€™s Medical Computer Vision Journey

ðŸš€ This is my personal lab for learning and building real-world AI solutions in the field of **medical computing and computer vision**. Iâ€™m a CS student with a strong passion for surgical technology and smart med-tech.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision & Goals

- Simulate and analyze **surgical videos** using OpenCV and deep learning
- Learn about **medical image segmentation**, detection, and enhancement
- Reconstruct hands-on experiments with **YOLO**, **Mediapipe**, and **Pytorch**
- Bridge my CS background with **clinical practice insights**

## ðŸ§ª First Demo: Surgical Image Enhancement with OpenCV

This demo improves visibility of low-light surgical footage using contrast enhancement.

```bash
# Run enhancement
python scripts/enhance_image.py data/surgery1.jpg
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- (Soon) YOLOv8, Mediapipe, MMDetection

---

## ðŸ“š Resources Used
- Surgical AI datasets (e.g., Cholec80, EndoVis)
- Medical CV papers
- Personal suturing footage (under study)
